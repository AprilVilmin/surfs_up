# Surfs Up with Python and Flask

## Overview of the Analysis:
You recently discovered that you love surfing and have decided that you want to move to Hawaii. You want to open a Surf n' Shake shop. You want to open your shop on Oahu. It will offer ice cream and surfing equipment. You have money to invest, but you are also seeking investors. You have put together a business plan and now have a meeting with W. Avy, an investor who likes surfing. He seems interested but is concerned about the weather. He has weather data for Oahu and wants you run analysis on it. It turns out he invested in a surf before but did not consider the weather and the surf shop went under. He does not want to make the same mistake. W. Avy wants to ensure this business module is practical year-round, so he has analysis ran on temperatures in June and December. You will use Flask to share your results on a website.

## Results: 
You were able to prove W. Avy a summary of weather data for both June and December. This is shown in the screenshots below. Below are details of three of the important results from June and December weather data.

### June Temperature Details

### December Temperature Details

- There were 1,700 temperatures collected for the month of June on the island of Oahu. While there were 1,517 temperatures collected for the month of December on the same island. Details can be found in the above screenshots.

 
- The max temperature for the month of June on the island Oahu is 85 degrees. The max temperature for the month of December on Oahu is 83 degrees. Details can be found in the above screenshots.

 
- The average temperature for the month of June on the island of Oahu is 75 degrees. The average temperature for the month of December on Oahu is 71 degrees. Details can be found in the above screenshots


## Summary: 
The overall temperature for June is slightly warmer than that of December for the lowest temperature, maximum temperature, and average temperature. The average temperature varies by only four degrees. If I were W. Avy after having already lost money due to an ill researched venture into the surfing business, I would request analysis/queries to see how the holidays in both June and December would impact the amount of travel to Oahu and whether these holidays happen to fall on the most ideal days of the given month. We would want to know how holidays impact tourism. For example, if the warmest days in December are holidays and because of this have very few tourists, it may give W. Avy reason to reconsider. I would also request additional analysis or queries be written around the top reporting weather stations. The average, minimum and maximum temperatures could vary at each station, and it would be in the best interest of this business proposal to pick a top reporting weather station with the highest temperature. Because one could assume that people would be more likely to surf and by ice cream the warmer the weather is. We would only want to consider the top three weather stations in this analysis as the more reports they have the higher accuracy they would have.
