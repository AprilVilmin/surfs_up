# Surfs Up

## Overview of Project
You recently discovered that you love surfing and have decided that you want to move to Hawaii. You want to open a Surf n' Shake shop. You want to open your shop on Oahu. It will offer ice cream and surffing equipment. You have some money to invest, but you are also seeking investors. You have put together a bussiness plan and now have a meeting with W. Avy, an investory who likes surfing. He seems interested, but is concerned about the weather. He has weather data for Oahu and wants you run analysis on it. It turns out he invested in a surf before, but didn't consider the weather and the surf shop went under. He doesn't want to make the same mistake. W. Avy wants to ensure this business module is practicle year round so he has analysis ran on temperatures in June and December.
